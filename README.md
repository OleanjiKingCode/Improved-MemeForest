# MemeForest 

This project is somewhat a social media platform for memes using these web3 technologies:
--> Rainbow [WAGMI Client]  : for wallet connection 
--> Arweave & Bundlr : for keeping the data of the meme
--> Next JS : frontend
--> Solidity : Backend
--> Hardhat


I wanted to make a Dapp using these technologies and add to my portfolio then i decided to make a platform where members can add memes for safe keeping, star memes to make it easier to find memes, like them to appreciate the meme, download them to get them on your device.

# Pages in MemeForest

             it the starred section.
--> Creations : Here are all the creations of the member

            charged on upload of memes. So this Funds section allows user to imburse thier account and also withdraw their funds.
